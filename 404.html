                <p>Welcome, adventurer. It would seem that you're a bit lost.<br>
                    It's great seeing someone here. Not many people venture into this place. Not voluntarily, anyway.<br>
                    But you can stay here and keep me company. Would you like a cup of choccy milk and cookies?
                </p>
                <p>I should warn you, though; this is a dark and empty place and it gets boring in here quite fast.<br>
                    It's okay if you want to get out of here, back to somewhere meaningful...<br>
                    If you do, just <a href="index.html">go this way</a>.
                </p>
                <p>Goodbye, adventurer. Please, come back again sometime, would you? Safe travels!</p>
